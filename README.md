# 🦀 XF402-rust

**XF402-rust** is the Rust / Solana reference implementation of the [XF402 protocol](https://github.com/yourusername/XF402) — an open standard for **time-based access**, **licensing**, and **temporary ownership** of digital assets.

It extends Coinbase’s [x402](https://github.com/coinbase/x402) payment primitive into a **smart contract layer** that supports:
- Renting NFTs
- Time-limited access passes
- Pay-per-use content unlocks
- On-chain proof of access (receipts)

---

## 🧩 Vision

> “Temporary rights. On-chain proof.”

This repo will eventually host the **core Rust program** and **on-chain schema** for XF402, defining:
- `R402Profile` — access tiers, duration, and price
- `Receipt` — proof of payment & validity
- `Verify` instruction — check if a wallet currently holds active access
